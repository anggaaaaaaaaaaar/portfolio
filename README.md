# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Anggar Pujianto

## About Me
Iâ€™m a Software Developer who enjoys working across the stack from building clean, responsive UIs with React.js, to developing reliable backend services with Java Spring Boot. Most of my day-to-day involves fixing bugs, improving features, deploying apps to servers, and checking logs to keep everything running smoothly.

I like solving problems, learning new things, and building software that makes life easier for users
